# Steels-Mars-Explorer-Simulation-with-Collaborative-Transport

## Time to tell a story...
Well, I am finishing my master degree in Artificial Inteligent in the "Universidad Politécnica de Madrid" 
[MUIA](http://www.dia.fi.upm.es/masteria/?q=es/MUIA) and I have to develop a program based on 
multiagent systems for the "Intelligent agents and multi-agent systems" class.

The Steels’ Mars explorer system caught my attention and I thought I could do a simulation of it. In addition it seemed 
to me that I could add to the simulation collective transport, since the stones that the robots transport could not 
be of the same weight and to move some of these rocks would be necessary several robots.

With this, I would simulate a real experiment at the same time that I would be adding my own ideas 
and improvements (more than enough to pass the class, besides that it seems an interesting experiment).

## Project State
For now the simulation has implemented the base experiment; The exploration of Mars with robots that collect stones.

In the future I will implement collective transport.

Currently the software is written in JavaScript and can be played in any browser. In the future, 
it is possible to implement a simulation in Unity (So I could use this project to learn Unity, 
which I have always been interested in)
